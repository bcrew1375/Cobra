# Cobra
A Nibbles-like clone written in Python.  There is a computer-controlled opponent enabled by default.  The opponent can be disabled by setting "OPPONENT_ON" to "False".

A browser-playable version is now available using CodeSkulptor.  It can be found here: https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user302_59hMUyi94v_7.py.  To play, click the run button at the top left, click inside the blank box on the new window to focus it, then press the space bar to begin the game.

The game will begin as soon as execution starts.  Arrow keys are used for movement.  The red rectangle is the player and the yellow rectangles are food.  With each piece of food eaten another segment is added.  The game ends when the player or opponent runs into the border, a segment of their body, or a segment of the opponent's body.
