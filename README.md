# Cobra
A Nibbles-like clone written in Python.  There is a computer-controlled opponent enabled by default.  The opponent can be disabled by setting "OPPONENT_ON" to "False".

The game will begin as soon as execution starts.  Arrow keys are used for movement.  The red rectangle is the player and the yellow rectangles are food.  With each piece of food eaten another segment is added.  The game ends when the player runs into the border, a segment of their body, or a segment of the opponent's body.
